#LCDZapperPro

Device for making lightgun games playable on modern LCD TVs. This is the second version of it, this time making it into one neat unit.

There's still some bugs to be worked out and the code tidied up ready for release but uploading now so people can see progress.

A video of the first version working can be found here:
